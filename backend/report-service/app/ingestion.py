"""In-cluster report ingestion: Textract OCR -> Nova summary -> Titan embeddings -> pgvector.

This is the docker-compose / single-instance equivalent of the S3-triggered Lambda in
serverless/ai-processing-pipeline (which is kept pristine for the EKS phase). It runs as a FastAPI
BackgroundTask after a staff upload, opening its own DB session because the request session is
already closed by the time the task runs.
